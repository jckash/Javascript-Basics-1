// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain





//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the time to take assessment of what the client wants and what the developers will need to build that."
const design = "This is where UI and UX design comes in to play. UI design will focus on the visual and interactive elements. UX design will focus on components that will lead to a meaningful experience for users."
const implementation = "During this step, the coders will begin building the vision designed by UI and UX."
const testingandIntegration = "The coders work is checked once it passes all tests that gaurantee it is working as intended. Then it is integrated to the web so that users can interact with it."
const maintain = "The software is in use. A team continues to ensure that it runs as intended while users interact."
